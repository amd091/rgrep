## About

This is a personal tool designed to search for code and instructions in a large codebase, using grep recursive search as a reference.

Future versions will feature better error handling, interactive navigation between outputted lines, case sensitivity, and the ability to open files through a text editor.

While there are many options available on GitHub with a similar purpose, feel free to give my code a try.
